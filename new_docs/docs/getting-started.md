Getting started with Nodal is easy.

1. Download and install the newest Node 5.x version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Open terminal, and type `npm install nodal -g`.
(If you get an error, run `sudo npm install nodal -g` or fix permissions permanently by
  [following these directions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)
3. Using your terminal, visit your projects folder. Perhaps with `cd ~`.
4. Run `nodal new`.
5. Follow the on screen instructions, enter your new project directory and type `nodal s`.

That's it! Your Nodal webserver is up and running.

## Quick Start Without npm

If you're not ready to use npm yet, you can download the starter kit which includes a prebuilt local installation of Nodal and an example Nodal API server `instatweet-api`.
