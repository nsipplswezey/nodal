Nodal is a JavaScript library for creating stateless APIs. Many people choose to think of React as the **MC** in **[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)**.

We built Nodal to solve one problem: **getting your data layer live online**.

## Simplicity and Readability

Nodal's focus is on communicating with the developer and has been crafted with you and your team in mind. The simplest explanation for what’s happening is exactly what’s going on behind the scenes.

## Saves Time

Nodal uses battle-tested server-side design patterns and abstractions, an provides out of the box Postgres integration, protecting developers from decision fatigue.

## Foundation for Scalability

We're all about building decoupled, stateless API services. Since they're so encapsulated, Nodal APIs make testing, deployment and scaling part of your API design, rather than an afterthought.
