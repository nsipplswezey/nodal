## Nodal 0.9: Deploy Your Nodal Projects to the Cloud with Polybit
Hey everyone! I'm pleased today to announce the official release of [Nodal 0.9](http://github.com/keithwhor/nodal).

Some of you may have noticed a bit of a slowdown of the Nodal release train - there's been a good reason. I'm really excited to share what we've been working on, and I'd like this to serve as the first introduction to [Polybit](http://www.polybit.com/), an API deployment solution for Nodal projects.

### Polybit: Deploy Your Nodal API Projects From the Command Line

The goal of Polybit is pretty straightforward - setting up infrastructure can be a pain in the behind, and a lot of developers would rather spend their time building products and writing code instead of figuring out how they're going to get your project live. So we've made it simple - one command, nodal `poly:deploy`, no hassle.

Begin with nodal `poly:register` and go from there!

I'll release more information about Polybit in the coming weeks, but for now, enjoy deploying *two projects and two PostgreSQL databases to the cloud, for free*.

The commands for deploying to Polybit are pretty straightforward. We don't use git deployments, we'll deploy your project folder (for the most part) as is, meaning you can test a staging environment without committing. I would like to make clear the current system is *Early Access*, so please report bugs by e-mailing *info (at) polybit (dot) com*. You can join the Nodal gitter channel to ask questions or report issues at [gitter.im/keithwhor/nodal](http://gitter.im/keithwhor/nodal).

All projects you create will be available on `https://[project].api.poly.cloud`.

The following command can be accessed from the Nodal CLI, i.e. by running nodal `[command]`. You can check this list any time (while running Nodal 0.9+) by typing nodal `help poly`.

```
poly:create [project]
    Creates a new, empty project

poly:db:assign [database] [project]

### Other Additions

We've added a few more things to this release and developed two new open source libraries while working on Polybit, [CMND](http://github.com/keithwhor/cmnd): A library for easily developing Command Line Interfaces in Node.js and [api-res](http://github.com/keithwhor/api-res): A wrapper around HTTP requests for easily dealing with Nodal API server requests and responses.
